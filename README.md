# Nemuri

Nemuri is a continuation of another project of mine destined to help me save some important files and remind me some problems I might have with my day to day software, I'm not the best but I try to keep a simple tone so I can have my things organized.

### How to use it?

```
git clone https://github.com/talialy/Nemuri
cd nemuri
chmod +x nemuri.sh
./nemuri.sh
```

If you're using this, you might wanna see my dotfiles too, just in case you'll need something to already start with ;)
